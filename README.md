Data Analysis Case Study
Overview
In this case study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of a dataset that included over 6,000 TV shows and 2,000 movies. The goal was to generate valuable insights into the content library through detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data cleaning processes.

Data Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Cleaning
We began by performing extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the structure and distribution of the dataset. This involved:

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, correcting data types, and ensuring consistency across the dataset.
Data Exploration: Identifying key patterns and trends in the data related to content types, genres, release years, and ratings.
Tools and Techniques
We utilized a variety of tools and techniques to conduct the analysis:

Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning, enabling efficient handling of the large dataset.
Regex: For text manipulation and extraction, particularly useful in cleaning and formatting string data.
Matplotlib: For creating visualizations that helped in uncovering trends and patterns in the dataset.
Insights Generated
The analysis revealed several valuable insights into the content offerings, such as the distribution of genres, trends in content release over the years, and patterns in user ratings. These insights can help in making data-driven decisions to enhance content strategy and user engagement.
